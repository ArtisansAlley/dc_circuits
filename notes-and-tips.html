                        <li>The set of activities are generally designed for senior high school students of the STEM strand regardless of the type of school management (private,
                        public, regular and science). However, you are free to modify the activities which you think that are appropriate for your students.
                        
                        <li>The activities can be given as desired whether as a laboratory activity, take-home learning module, teacher-assisted module, etc. for as long as the 7 phases
                        or stages are accomplished according to the sequence of the activities provided.
                        <li>Make sure that the computer units are pre-installed with the required software to run the simulation. Test the computers and simulations before letting the
                        students perform the set of activities.
                        <li>A lesson exemplar is provided as your reference or guide. The content standards and competencies are all taken from the teaching guide for general
                        physics 2 for senior high schools.
                        <li>Make sure that each of your student possesses the basic computer skills (internet and email, computers, word processing, graphics and multimedia, and
                        spreadsheets). If not, it is necessary for you to teach them these basic skills as part of the pre-discussion.
                        <li>You may print the data and observation sheets for distribution to your students. However, another option is for your students to download the sheets in
                        MS word format in which they can directly encode their answers then send these to your email. Just make sure to instruct the students on the method of
                        submitting the activity sheets prior to the start of the first phase.
