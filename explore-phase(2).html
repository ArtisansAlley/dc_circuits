                            <b>1. </b> Using the previously constructed circuit diagram (series connection) in activity 3.1, measure the amount voltage across the battery, across each of the two
                            resistors and across the bulb using the voltmeter found at the right panel. Drag and drop the voltmeter in the working area then simply touch the negative
                            and positive test probes (leads) to any two points in the circuit. The switch must always be on during this process. If a negative voltage is displayed, the
                            probes are simply interchanged which can be corrected by switching the red and black test probes. List down the values in the data and observation sheet.
                            Take note that the voltage supplied by the battery is the total voltage. List down the values in the data and observation sheet (Table 1).

                            <b>2. </b> After measuring the voltages, return the voltmeter to the right panel using the drag and drop process.

                            <b>3. </b>Measure the current supplied by the battery, current passing through the resistors and the bulb using the ammeter. Remember that the ammeter must
                            become part of the circuit to obtain a reading. However, the simulation provides you the option to use the non-contact ammeter. For this activity, please use
                            the contact ammeter, the one with connecting ends or leads. Disconnect or split the circuit in the positive end of the battery then insert the ammeter. Do the
                            same for the bulb and the two resistors to get the current reading through these. In total, there must be four (4) ammeters in the circuit. Compare the
                            equivalent current (batteryâ€™s current) with that of the individual currents through the resistors and the bulb. List down the values in the data and observation
                            sheet (Table 1).

                            <b>4. </b>After taking all measurements, refresh the simulation page to start a new working space. Using the same circuit elements (12V battery with no battery
                            resistance, a switch, a bulb of 6-ohm resistance, an 8-ohm resistor and a 10-ohm resistor), make a parallel circuit. Each of the resistor, the battery and the
                            bulb should be in separate branches. All components should be connected between the same set of electrically common points called nodes. For this part,
                            you may discuss with your groupmates on how to come up with a parallel circuit.
