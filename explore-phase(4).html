                            In the previous activity (Activity 3.3), Ohm’s law can be used alone by combining the resistors and come up with the equivalent resistance to solve for
                            voltages and currents circulating within the circuit. However, the circuit presented above cannot be simply broken down into series or parallel connections.
                            This type of circuit requires the use of Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) which is also known as junction rule and the Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) normally
                            referred to as the loop rule.

                            <b>4. </b> Using the non-tact ammeter, measure the current passing through each branch. Take note that there are three branches in this circuit separated by nodes
                            a and b. The first branch from node a to node b through the 10 Ω resistor and the 20V battery. The second branch is from node a to node b that
                            encompasses the 20Ω resistor while the last branch is from node a to node b through the 15Ω resistor and 10V battery. List the values in Table 1 under the
                            column “measured” in the data and observation sheet.

                            <b>5. </b> Label the current passing through the first branch as I1, the second branch as I2 and the last branch as I3 in the diagram you have drawn. Doing this
                            indicates that there are three separate values of current for each branch.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-0">
                            <b>6. </b>The values of voltage and current you have measured can be computed using Kirchhoff’s laws. To solve for the current passing through the resistors in
                            each of the branch, the junction rule or Kirchhoff’s current law should be used. Applying the rule, take node a as the point where I1 enters and leaves as I2
                            and I3. A current that enters a junction is assigned with a positive convention while a negative sign is for current that leaves the junction. Thus, the junction
                            rule implies that I1-I2-I3 =0. At node b, the equation is I2+I3 -I1= 0 which is the same with that of node a. Transforming this equation will result to I1=I2+I3.
                            Write this equation in your solution and label it as equation 1.
                        </p>

                            <b>7. </b> To solve for the voltage across each resistor, the loop rule will be used. A loop is a simple closed path in a circuit in which no circuit elements or nodes is
                            run into more than once. In the circuit, there are a total of three loops indicated by the blue lines. The direction of the loops (clockwise or counterclockwise)
                            can be arbitrarily chosen. You can simply choose the direction you want. In your diagram, label the loops as loop 1 (left inner loop), loop 2 (right inner loop)
                            and loop 3 (biggest outer loop).
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-0">
                            <b>8. </b> Use the loop rule to solve for the voltage/potential difference across the resistors. Accordingly, the algebraic sum of all voltages in a closed loop is zero.
                            Using this principle, determine the equations for all loops. Start from the battery or a resistor then move around the loop making a complete loop. Take note
                            that from Ohm’s law, V=IR.
