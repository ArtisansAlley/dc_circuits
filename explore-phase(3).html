                            The circuit presented is a combination of series and parallel connection. It contains 3 branches, one for the location of the battery, another branch for the 4Ω
and 10Ω resistor and the last branch for the 20Ω and 15Ω resistor. The 4Ω and 10Ω resistors are in series with one another. When combined, the equivalent
resistance for these two resistors are in parallel with the equivalent resistance of the 20Ω and 15Ω resistors which are also connected in series.
