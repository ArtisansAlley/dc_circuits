									their computer (offline or online) through the students’ resource page. Printed data and observation sheets should have been
									distributed to the students prior to the start of the first phase (elicit).

									Students are required to perform a short activity for them to recall their knowledge about Ohm’s law. However, at the end of
									the activity, they are required to answer the following questions related to the learning competencies of the present subject
									matter:<br/>
									a. What makes a parallel connection different from a series connection?<br/>
									b. What do you think will happen to the individual and total voltage, current, and resistance if the circuit elements are to be
									connected in series or in parallel?<br/>
									c. How are you going to determine or solve the individual and equivalent voltage, current, and resistance if the circuit elements are connected in combination of series and parallel?<br/>
									<br/>
									Students will write their short responses on their daily logs then share with their groupmates

								<td>Students are grouped by three’s or four’s depending on their number and are challenged explore how complex circuits are
resolved using matrix. The objective of the activity is for students to use matrix in solving for the unknow current in each branch
of a complex circuits. The activity can be given as an assignment if needed.</td>
